# [PasswordPals](http://password-pals.co/) 🧑‍💻🔑

## Inspiration 🌈
As a kid, you probably made some questionable passwords, like `unicornrainbow123` 🦄🌈.  
The problem? Weak passwords are easy to guess, leaving your accounts unprotected 🔓.  
We aim to bring awareness regarding cybersecurity to the younger generation in a fun and interactive way 🎮👾.

## What it does 🎯
Our app teaches children how to build strong passwords through:
- Fun games 🎮
- A friendly, AI-powered chatbot 🤖
- Cute motivation ‘Key’ mascot 🔑

## How we built it 🛠️
- Vanilla.js, HTML, CSS
- Node.js, Gemini API for the chat bot
- Figjam for ideation, Figma for design templates
- github.io pages to deploy initially
- GoDaddy for domain name 🌐

## Challenges we ran into 😅
- Using and learning how to integrate Gemini API for the first time, as none of our members had previous experience in this area 🤔
- Our game progress bar was not moving properly ⏳
- We realized we were not implementing it in a logical sense 💡
- Being sleep-deprived (we all worked really hard and pulled all-nighters) 😴💪

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉
- Integrating Gemini API successfully 🚀
- We are all beginner hackers and we successfully designed, created, and deployed a website within 24 hours, which is a big accomplishment for us! 🎨💻
  - 1 of our hackers is a 1st timer ✨
  - 2 of our hackers are 2nd timers 🔄
  - 1 of our hackers is a 3rd timer 🔄🔄
- Leveraging technology to build a more socially sustainable future for children 🌱💡

## What we learned 📚
- Using Gemini API 🧑‍💻
- Learning how to deploy using a custom domain name 🌍
- Using Filmora to create the video demo 🎥
- Creating a kid-friendly UI/UX interactive design that had a mascot and vibrant color scheme 🎨🧸. We conducted various user interviews to understand our demographic better.

## What's next for PasswordPals 🔮
- Adding a database password manager simulation similar to 1Password so users can understand how to store their passwords in a safe and secure way 🔐
- Transforming the website into a Chrome extension that provides real-time reminders for creating strong passwords, like length and special character requirements 💬🔒
- Target cybersecurity education for elderly people who might get scammed because of lack of technological knowledge 👵💻
